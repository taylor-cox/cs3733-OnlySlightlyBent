# OnlySlightlyBent
Group Project for 2019 Software Engineering B-Term

The project you have found focused on creating a video mashup tool that allows users to import videos from local and remote libraries to create mashup playlists that are manipulable. Implementing Amazon Web Services, the project features functional lambda functions that carry out the backend services to the project. 

The presigned URL will bring you to the normal, user side of the website. From here, the user can request a list of uploaded video segments, the playlists that are currently created, and upload video segments. They can create a new playlist, append a new video to a playlist, and delete a playlist. They can also search within the database for videos that feature a certain quote or character, which will be shown if available.   

To access the administator side of the the website, you must press the photo of George that is located at the top left corner of the website. The user (an administrator) can add and remote video sites for videos and mark/unmark them. They can also delete the video from the database.
